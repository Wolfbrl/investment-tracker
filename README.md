# investment dashboard prototype
  
A clean and minimalistic portfolio manager built in Java, designed to help users easily track their investments over time.

The application uses a local SQLite database to store all investment data securely on the user's machine â€” keeping things private and offline.

note: This is my very first project outside of school assignments, I know the code is messy.
