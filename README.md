# Investment Tracker
  
It's a clean and minimalistic portfolio manager built in Java, designed to help users easily track their investments over time.

The application uses a local SQLite database to store all investment data securely on the user's machine â€” keeping things private and offline.

## Features

- User Authentication + password encryption

- Dynamic Portfolio Chart  
  
- Investment Overview Table  
  
- Live News Feed Based On Holdings

- Secure Local Storage for safety and privacy

## Future Ideas

- Export portfolio to PDF or CSV  
- Online sync and cloud backup

## Personal Note

This is my very first project outside of school assignments. I built it to challenge myself and practice integrating JavaFX, data persistence, and external APIs

Feel free to try it out, give feedback, or fork it.
